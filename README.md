# Ts-pymfe tests
Tests for the pymfe expansion for handling univariate time-series data, comparing the efficiency of the time-series metafeatures against the standard supervised learning meta-features for time-series classification.

All methods for extracting time-series meta-features are available at https://github.com/FelSiq/ts-pymfe.

## Repository organization
Each experiment part is separated in a distinct, modularized, Jupyter notebook.

The sub-directories are enumerated in natural order, implying which order each notebook is supposed to be run.
